  <p> This site is created to facilitate the development of all kinds of software by conducting of scrum meetings. 
    It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, 
    called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed stand-up meetings, 
    called daily scrums.Boost up ur perfomance!  </p>
